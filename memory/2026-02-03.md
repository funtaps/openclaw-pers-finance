## Lessons Learned

**Pick the right tool, not the first suggestion.**
When Kirill said "Google Sheets or something" — I jumped on Sheets without thinking. Result: messy spreadsheet via API that didn't work. Better approach: simple files + Python script. 

Rule: When user suggests a tool casually ("or something"), pause and think — what's the *best* tool for this job given my capabilities? Don't blindly follow light suggestions.

## Setup Completed

### Google Calendar Integration
- **gog CLI** installed and working
- Environment variables set permanently in OpenClaw config:
  - `GOG_KEYRING_PASSWORD=gog-pass`
  - `GOG_ACCOUNT=funtovkd@eruditor-group.com`
- Can query calendars: `gog calendar events funtovkd@eruditor-group.com --from ... --to ...`
- Calendars available: funtovkd@eruditor-group.com, event@vash-repetitor.ru, others

### Model Provider Switch
- Switched from OpenRouter to direct Anthropic API
- Now using `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5`
- Auth profile: `anthropic:manual`

## Personal Finance Discussion (started, not completed)

Kirill wants help with financial awareness and habits. His situation:
- **Income**: Salary in RUB (rubles)
- **Rent**: Paid in USD
- **Daily spending**: In GEL (Georgian Lari)
- **Problem**: Doesn't know monthly spending capacity in GEL, total net worth across accounts

### What I proposed:
1. Net worth snapshot (monthly) - total across all accounts in base currency (USD)
2. Monthly flow tracking - income vs expenses per currency
3. Conversion tracking - when/at what rates he converts RUB→USD→GEL

### Next steps:
- Build a simple tracking system (spreadsheet or plain files)
- Script to fetch exchange rates
- Start with net worth calculator - need him to list accounts/amounts/currencies

## Notes
- Kirill is honest about not understanding "why" financial tracking matters
- I explained: can't optimize what you don't measure, multi-currency = risk, emergency readiness, accumulation requires knowing surplus
